# GCS Pipeline Scripts

## Introduction
At the [Edge Conference](https://edge.akamai.com/ec/us/), we are presenting on a topic on how to integrate the Akamai configuration management into a CI/CD pipeline. For this purpose, we had to create a set of scripts to demonstrate the functionality. This repository will host the scripts that were created for this purpose.

## Script Details
Here's an index of the scripts that are part of the repository.

- Unit test script.
- Git version comparison tool - This will be used by Jenkins to detect newer versions of the Gold Configuration and then add it to the repository.

## Requirements
To run the scripts, please use _python3_.

If you are running in a virtual environment, please refer to the __requiements.txt__ necessary for the depencies.
